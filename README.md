# Showcase

A personal full stack journey. Consisting out of:

* Micro Services
* Micro (modular) Front End
* Simulation Driven Development

## Status

Very much under construction. Started with the back end and setting up docker containers and npm scripts.

## Stack used

### Micro services

In Microsoft technologies there are mainly three promising technologies. The main reason why I choose dapr over other technologies are as follows:

* Orleans only supports Actors
* More official SDK integrations for multiple languages
* Excellent documentation
* Fastest growing community
* Fast release train

#### Popularity

As per January 29th 2020

#### Runtime language services

![sdk language services](./docs/images/runtime-language-services.svg)

#### dapr Release Train

![](./docs/images/dapr-release-train.png)

## Setup

The VSCODE project consists out of Tasks/Launch json configuration. On top of this some utilities are installed as NPM packages. The scripts that are shipped in package.json with the solution are installed as dev dependencies and these node modules are executed with `npx`.

### Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/showcase.git
```

To get up and running with dapr solution. `cd to the ./showcase/src/dapr folder` from the root of the cloned repo and install the node modules.

```
cd ./showcase/src/dapr
npm install
```

### Setting up secrets (important)

dapr stores its secrets in the `./src/dapr/secrets.json` file. The secrets component configuration itself can be found in:  `./src/dapr/components/localSecretStore.yaml`. This configuration is used for `standalone mode` during your debug sessions. You will need to replace the full path to match the location of the file on your dev workstation (replace %Your Path%).

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-secret-store
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: secretstores.local.file
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: secretsFile
    value: %Your Path%/showcase/src/dapr/secrets.json
  - name: nestedSeparator
    value: ":"
```


### vscode debug launch

When starting up a new VSCode editor, in `./src/dapr/`, the project contains several launch options. The most important one you will be working with is `debug all microservices`

#### Debug all micro services

This will startup the entire environment as depicted in the `high level overview`. At the time of this writing the micro orchestrator is not yet integrated in the debugging experience.

The debug options can be found in the left pane.

![debug all micro services](./docs/images/debug-all-micro-services.png)

#### Service registry and ports

The following URL's will be available as GraphQL service endpoints (and RESTful for that matter) when debugging in standalone mode.

##### Swagger endpoints

| Micro Service                      	| Native                  	| Dapr                                                          	|

##### GraphQL endpoints

| Micro Service      	| Native                  	| Dapr                                                          	|
|--------------------	|-------------------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------	|

| dapr.gql.product   	| localhost:10005/graphql 	| localhost:20005/v1.0/invoke/dapr-gql-product/method/graphql   	|

##### GraphQL Gateway

The GraphQL gateway federates all services. The sticthing gateway can be opened in your web browser at: http://localhost:9999/graphql when debugging.

Next to federation it also stiches schema's such as mybasket, to join several graphs from several micro services (basket, product and inventory) into one query endpoint. At the time of this writing, the gaphql gateway is still tested to the native graphql query endpoints and will soon change to be served from the dapr endpoints.

Here is the stitching example:

```graphql
# Stitching sub graphs for UX Design of the Basket View
extend type Query {
    "This is an extended query which shows a basket for the current logged in customer along with the products. This view is in accordance with the UX design and contains delegated fields from the inventory and product database"
    mybasket: [BasketItem!]! @delegate(schema: "basket", path: "basketForCustomer(id: 1)")
}

extend type BasketItem {
    "delegates the name of the product in the basket from product"
    name: String
        @delegate(
            schema: "product",
            path: "product(id: $fields:productId).name"
        )
    "delegates the description of the product in the basket from product"
    description: String
        @delegate(
            schema: "product",
            path: "product(id: $fields:productId).description"
        )
    "delegates the unit price of the product"
    unitPrice: Float
        @delegate(
            schema: "product",
            path: "product(id: $fields:productId).unitPrice"
        )
    "delegates the available stock of the product in the basket from the inventory"
    inStock: Int
        @delegate(
            schema: "inventory",
            path: "inventory(id: $fields:productId).quantity"
        )
}

```

### npm Scripts

The following section describes the available scripts:

#### gql-doc

Documents the graphql schema from the stitching/federated graphql gateway endpoint. Output example [here](https://sjefvanleeuwen.github.io/showcase/schemas/graphql/).

```
npm run gql-doc
```

#### gql-schemas

Fetches the schema from the stitching/federated graphql gateway endpoint via curl and places it in the `./generated` folder.

```
npm run gql-schema
```

#### gqlg

Generates a javascript serverside (nodejs) graphql client for the gateway. This command is dependend on gql-schema.
*note* this generator can not interpret the @source directive containing a repeatable ENUM. Please remove it from the fetched `schema.graphql` file in the `./generated-folder`
This command is going to be replaced by a better client/server code generator. Such as the one available at: https://graphql-code-generator.com/

```
npm run gqlg
```
#### test / test-dashboard

Executes newman integration tests from the ./tests directory, which contains postman configurations. It exports the test results using a html reporter `newman-reporter-html-extra`

This command generates a new test report per run, with date/time stamp in the filename and puts it in the `./tests/` folder.

```
npm run test
```

This command overwrites a test file in the `../docs/tests/newmann folder`. Putting the live webserver on that file will result in the dashboard updated in the browser at each run. Good for dashboarding.

```
npm run test-dashboard
```

You can see an example of the dashboard [here](https://sjefvanleeuwen.github.io/showcase/tests/newman/dashboard.html)

## High Level Overview

High level overview of what I am building.

![High Level Overview](./docs/images/high-level.svg)

## Hosting Modes

### Micro services

At this time the micro services run in self hosted mode. The eventual "production" mode is targeted towards kubernetes.

![Hosting Modes](./docs/images/hosting-modes.svg)

# Deploying to Kubernetes

Time to shift our focus on the Kubernetes hosting mode. This is also known as `Dapr First`. Dapr is a world class citizen when it comes to deployment to kubernetes. We will be deploying the dapr solution to the Azure cloud using `azure cli`.

## Setup dapr on Azure AKS kubernetes

Please follow the guide [here](./docs/kubernetes/setup-aks-cluster.md)

## Setup your container registry

Please follow the guide [here](./docs/docker/setup-azure-container-registry.md)

## Deploying Dapr services (from vscode)

The `./src/dapr` project comes with a .sln file, binding all services together. When developing larger services landscapes these can be seperated out as you scale your application. For now however we can make use of one of the Tasks that will containerize our services in order to get ready for kubernetes deployment via the Azure service registry you have already set up by now.

### Building your docker containers

In vscode, got to the task run list by pressing ctrl+ shift+p to open the command palette.

From the list pick `Task: Run Task`

Select the `build all dockers: latest`.

This will build the containers for the micro services, including the gateway

If you installed the visual studio extension for docker as indicated under `Install additional tools` in this document, you can easily check if the images are build for your docker installation.

The images list should contain the `basket, customer, inventory and payment` microserevices. Also the `gql.gateway` should be in the list.
